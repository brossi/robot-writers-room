# Robot Writers Room - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# === OpenAI Configuration ===
# Your OpenAI API key (required for LLM access)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# === LLM Configuration ===

# Language model to use for all agents
# Options: gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-3-opus, etc.
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4

# Enable streaming output (shows agent responses in real-time)
LLM_STREAMING=true

# Temperature for language model (0.0-2.0, higher = more creative)
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# === Story Generation Parameters ===

# Number of brainstorming iterations (round-robin agent turns)
BRAINSTORM_ITERATIONS=2

# Number of chapters to generate in the outline
NUM_CHAPTERS=30

# Target pages per chapter
PAGES_PER_CHAPTER=10

# === File Paths ===

# Path to secrets file (contains API keys)
SECRETS_FILE=secrets.json

# Output file paths (relative to project root)

# === State Store Configuration ===

# Data directory for state storage (events.jsonl, cards.index.json)
STATE_DATA_DIR=data

# Backend implementation (currently only "jsonl" is supported)
# Future: "graphiti", "sqlite", etc.
STATE_BACKEND=jsonl

# Enable reading from StateStore instead of legacy cards.json
# Set to "true" to use event-sourced state for reads
# Set to "false" (default) to use legacy cards.json (shadow mode)
USE_STATE_FOR_READS=false

# Enable dual-write mode (write to both StateStore and legacy cards.json)
# Recommended: keep enabled during transition period
# Set to "false" once confident in StateStore implementation
DUAL_WRITE=true

# === Feature Flags ===

# Enable context shard injection for agents
# Provides agents with historical context from the state store
ENABLE_CONTEXT_SHARD=false

# Agents that should receive automatic context injection (comma-separated)
# Example: Scribe,Researcher,Outliner
CONTEXT_SHARD_AGENTS=Scribe

# Default time window for context shards (relative time format)
# Examples: "-30m" (last 30 minutes), "-2h" (last 2 hours), "-1d" (last day)
CONTEXT_SHARD_TIME_WINDOW=-30m

# Maximum events to include in context shard
CONTEXT_SHARD_MAX_EVENTS=30

# === Logging Configuration ===

# Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
